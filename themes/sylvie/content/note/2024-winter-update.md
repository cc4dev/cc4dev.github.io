> Cause, why not?

3 months ago, I only dared to dream of getting into my dream university - **HCMUS**. Now that I’m halfway through the first semester in HCMUS, I want to reflect on the experience so far.

## Math is hard
Math here is freaking hard. I was and still struggling to keep up with the pace of the lectures. I’m not sure if I can make it through the semester.

## A lot of group projects
University gives you a lot of group projects. I’m not a fan of group projects, but I have to admit that it’s a good way to learn how to work with others.

Through group projects, I’ve learned how to communicate effectively, how to manage my time better, and how to work with people who have different working styles.

## Friends
I’ve made a few friends here through group projects. They came from all over the country, so now I know more about the culture and people from different regions of Vietnam besides my hometown.

## TLDR
I’m still struggling with math, working on group projects and trying to make new friends.

## My goals
- Pass all the subjects.
- Learn how to code better.
- Have a girlfriend (optional, harder than math).
